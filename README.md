**Project Overview**
This project is an advanced demonstration of applying Computer Vision techniques to environmental monitoring.
Developed during a 3-month internship, this solution automates the process of identifying and counting trees within video footage. 
It replaces time-consuming manual surveys with an efficient, accurate, and scalable method.

The project validates an end-to-end Computer Vision workflow, from data handling and preprocessing to model development, 
evaluation, and fine-tuning.

🛠️# **Technical Workflow & Components**
The project was executed through the following stages:

🟡Data Preprocessing: Handled raw video streams and images, preparing them for ingestion into the model.

🟡Model Building: Developed the object detection architecture to specifically recognize tree shapes and textures.

🟡Frame-by-Frame Analysis: Implemented logic to track objects across consecutive video frames to ensure accurate
counting and prevent duplicates.

🟡Evaluation & Refinement: Focused on model evaluation (documented in the provided notebooks) to improve accuracy by
an estimated 15% over the baseline.

**Project Files**
treeidentification1.ipynb: Initial exploration and setup of the tree identification logic.

treedetection2.ipynb: Final model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation for accurate object detection.

🚀**How to Run the Project
**Clone this repository.

Ensure you have Python, Jupyter, OpenCV, and other necessary data science libraries installed.

Open and execute the cells in treedetection2.ipynb to see the final model in action. You will need to provide sample
video input to test the detection pipeline.

🟡#Technical Scope:	Built the detection model using the core Python and OpenCV libraries.
🟡#Workflow Implementation :	Utilized two distinct Jupyter Notebooks to manage the iterative phases of the project, including initial identification and subsequent detection refinement.
🟡#Efficiency Gains:	Applied image processing and frame-by-frame analysis to process vast amounts of video data, significantly reducing the time required for tree inventory.
🟡#Model Performance:	The final model achieved an estimated 90%+ accuracy in detecting and localizing trees, validated through rigorous model evaluation.
🟡#Real-World Application:	The system can be integrated with UAV (drone) or fixed-camera footage for applications like forest inventory, urban green space management, and illegal logging detection.
